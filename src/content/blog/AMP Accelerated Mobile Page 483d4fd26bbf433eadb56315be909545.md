# AMP Accelerated Mobile Page

Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is an open-source initiative that aims to make web pages load quickly and efficiently on mobile devices. It is a set of guidelines and technologies that help developers create pages that are optimized for mobile browsers.

**Key Features of AMP**

- **Optimized for mobile:** AMP pages are designed to load quickly and efficiently on mobile devices, even with slow or unreliable internet connections. This is achieved by using a stripped-down version of HTML and JavaScript, as well as by limiting the number of resources that are loaded by the page.
- **Cached by CDNs:** AMP pages are cached by a Content Delivery Network (CDN), which means that they are stored on servers around the world. This allows the pages to load more quickly for users, as they can be served from a server that is closer to them geographically.
- **Validated and secure:** AMP pages are validated by the AMP Project to ensure that they meet the AMP guidelines. This helps to ensure that pages are consistent and that they do not contain any malicious code.

**Benefits of AMP**

- **Improved user experience:** Faster-loading pages lead to a better user experience, as users are less likely to abandon a page if it takes too long to load. This can lead to increased conversions and engagement.
- **Higher search rankings:** Google gives preference to AMP pages in its search results, which can help websites to get more traffic from organic search.
- **Reduced development time:** AMP pages are relatively simple to develop, as they use a limited set of technologies. This can save developers time and effort.

**How to Create AMP Pages**

There are a few different ways to create AMP pages. You can use the AMP HTML validator to check your pages for compliance with the AMP guidelines. You can also use a variety of AMP-compliant CMS and content management platforms.

**Who Uses AMP?**

A number of major publishers and content providers use AMP, including The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and The Washington Post. AMP is also used by a number of advertisers, including Google Ads and Facebook Ads.

Overall, AMP is a valuable tool for creating fast, reliable, and engaging mobile web experiences. It can help websites to improve their SEO, conversions, and user satisfaction.
