Issue Resolution Rate= (Number of Resolved Issues / Total Number of Issues Raised) × 100

**Key Points:**

1. **Resolved Issues:** The number of customer problems or concerns that have been successfully resolved to the customer's satisfaction.
2. **Total Issues Raised:** The overall number of issues or complaints raised by customers through digital channels, such as social media, email, or online support platforms.

A high issue resolution rate is indicative of **effective customer service** and can **positively impact customer satisfaction and brand reputation**. It demonstrates the brand's commitment to addressing customer concerns promptly and efficiently in the digital landscape. Monitoring this metric allows digital marketers to assess the performance of their customer support efforts and make improvements to enhance the overall customer experience.
