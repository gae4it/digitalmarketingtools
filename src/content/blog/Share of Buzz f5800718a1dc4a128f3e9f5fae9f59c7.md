Share of Buzz

"Share of buzz" in digital marketing is a metric that measures the proportion of online conversations, discussions, or mentions related to a specific brand, product, or topic in comparison to its competitors within a particular industry or market. It provides insights into the brand's share of attention and visibility within the digital space.
