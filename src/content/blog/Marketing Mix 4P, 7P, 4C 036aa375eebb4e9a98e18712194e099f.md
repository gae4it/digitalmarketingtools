# Marketing Mix 4P, 7P, 4C

4Ps (Product, Price, Promotion, Positioning):

- Product: Define your product or service and identify its unique features and customer benefits.
- Price: Determine the appropriate price for your product or service based on competition, production costs and perceived value to customers.
- Promotion: Develop effective promotional strategies using means such as advertising, public relations, direct marketing and social media.
- Positioning: Identify how you want to position your brand in the minds of consumers compared to competitors.

7P (Adding the three additional P's):

- Process: Define the company's internal processes that contribute to the delivery of the product or service to the customer.
- People: Consider the importance of company personnel in providing an excellent customer experience and develop strategies to adequately recruit, train and incentivise staff.
- Proof: Provide tangible evidence of the quality of your product or service through satisfied customer testimonials, positive reviews or certifications.

The 4Cs in marketing is an alternative framework that is sometimes used to complement or replace the traditional 4Ps (Product, Price, Place, and Promotion) model. The 4Cs model places a stronger emphasis on customer-centric marketing and is often seen as a more customer-focused approach. The 4Cs stand for Customer, Cost, Convenience, and Communication. Here's an explanation of each of the 4Cs:

1. **Customer:** In the 4Cs framework, the "Customer" takes the place of "Product" in the traditional 4Ps model. It emphasizes the need to start with a deep understanding of the customer's needs, wants, and preferences. This includes identifying the target audience, their demographics, behaviors, and motivations. By putting the customer at the center of marketing efforts, businesses aim to create products or services that truly meet customer demands.
2. **Cost:** "Cost" replaces "Price" in the traditional model. While "Price" focuses on setting a specific monetary value for the product or service, "Cost" shifts the focus to the customer's perspective. It includes not only the actual price but also any other costs associated with the purchase. These costs may include time, effort, and any hidden costs that the customer incurs in obtaining and using the product. Understanding the total cost to the customer is vital for effective marketing.
3. **Convenience:** "Convenience" encompasses the concept of "Place" from the traditional 4Ps. It emphasizes making the product or service as convenient as possible for the customer to access. This involves decisions related to distribution channels, accessibility, and the overall customer experience. The goal is to ensure that customers can easily find, purchase, and use the product or service with minimal hassle.
4. **Communication:** "Communication" replaces "Promotion" and focuses on how businesses engage with customers. It includes the various ways companies communicate with their audience, such as advertising, content marketing, social media, and public relations. Effective communication is not just about promoting the product, but also about building relationships, providing information, and addressing customer needs and concerns.

The 4Cs model is seen as a more customer-oriented approach to marketing because it places the customer's needs and experience at the forefront of decision-making. By understanding the customer deeply and considering their perspective in terms of cost, convenience, and communication, businesses can create more relevant and effective marketing strategies. While the 4Ps and 4Cs models can be used separately or in conjunction, the 4Cs model is especially useful in today's customer-centric marketing landscape where personalized and customer-focused strategies are often prioritized.
