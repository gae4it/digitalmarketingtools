Focus keywords, also known as key phrases or primary terms, are central in search engine optimization (SEO). They are the words or phrases you target in your SEO strategy and website content to improve your visibility in search engine results like Google. Here are some key points about focus keywords:

1. Relevance: Focus keywords should closely relate to the content of your website or post, representing the main themes or key concepts you want to convey.
2. Search Volume: It's crucial to choose keywords that your target audience frequently searches for. You can use keyword tools to determine the average monthly search volume for specific keywords.
3. Competition: Consider the level of competition for a particular keyword. Highly competitive keywords typically require more effort to rank well. Therefore, it may make sense to include both high and low-competition keywords in your strategy.
4. Monitoring and Adjustment: Regularly monitor the performance of your focus keywords. You can use SEO tools to track rankings and traffic and adjust your strategy as needed.

Thematic keywords, on the other hand, are terms or phrases that are thematically related and cover a specific topic or niche. Unlike individual keywords, thematic keywords are groups of terms that are interconnected and point to a broader concept or category. They play a significant role in SEO because search engines like Google increasingly focus on semantic meaning and content relevance. Here are the key points about thematic keywords:

1. Semantic Relevance: Thematic keywords represent a semantic cluster of terms that are conceptually linked, helping search engines better understand the context of your content.
2. Better Coverage: By using thematic keywords, you can address a wider range of related search queries, attracting more traffic and reaching a broader audience.
3. Content Structuring: Thematic keywords can be used to organize the structure of your website or content, assisting in creating thematically related subpages or blog posts.
4. Long-Tail Keywords: Within a thematic cluster, you can also use long-tail keywords. These more specific phrases are often less competitive and can attract more targeted traffic.
