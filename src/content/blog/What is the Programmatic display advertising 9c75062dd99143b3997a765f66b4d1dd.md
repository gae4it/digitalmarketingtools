What is the Programmatic display advertising?

Programmatic display advertising is a type of digital advertising that involves the automated buying and placement of online display ads. It uses technology and algorithms to target specific audiences and deliver ads in real-time through ad exchanges and demand-side platforms (DSPs). Here's how programmatic display advertising works:

1. **Audience Targeting**: Advertisers can define their target audience based on various parameters such as demographics, location, browsing behavior, and interests.
2. **Real-Time Bidding (RTB)**: When a user visits a website that has available ad space, the ad exchange conducts an auction in real-time. Advertisers submit bids for that ad space based on how well the user matches their target audience criteria.
3. **Ad Placement**: The highest bidder wins the auction and their ad is displayed to the user on the website in a matter of milliseconds.
4. **Optimization**: Programmatic advertising platforms continuously analyze the performance of ads and adjust the bidding and targeting strategies to maximize ROI.
5. **Reporting and Analytics**: Advertisers have access to detailed data and analytics to track the performance of their campaigns, including impressions, clicks, conversions, and more.

Programmatic display advertising offers several advantages, including the ability to reach highly specific audiences, optimize campaigns in real-time, and potentially lower advertising costs. It can involve various ad formats, such as banner ads, video ads, native ads, and more.
