In digital marketing, the terms "net" and "gross" are often used to refer to different metrics and values.

1. **Net Range:**
    - **Net Reach:** This is the actual number of unique users or audience that a digital marketing campaign is able to connect with after eliminating any duplications.
    - **Net Clicks:** The total number of clicks on an ad or link, excluding any duplicate or fraudulent clicks.
    - **Net Conversions:** The number of desired actions taken by users (such as making a purchase or filling out a form) after removing any duplicate or invalid conversions.
    
2. **Gross Range:**
    - **Gross Reach:** This is the total number of impressions or views of a digital marketing campaign without considering whether they are unique or not. It includes all instances, even if the same user sees the ad multiple times.
    - **Gross Clicks:** The total number of clicks on an ad or link, including all clicks, whether they are unique or repeated.
    - **Gross Conversions:** The total number of desired actions taken by users without excluding any duplicates or invalid conversions.
    

In essence, "net" values give a more refined and accurate measure by removing duplications or invalid interactions, while "gross" values provide a broader overview of the total activity without considering such factors. It's important for marketers to understand both perspectives to evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns.
