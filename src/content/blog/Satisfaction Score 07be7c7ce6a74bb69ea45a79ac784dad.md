Satisfaction Score

In digital marketing, a "Satisfaction Score" typically refers to a metric that **measures the level of satisfaction customers have with a particular product, service, or brand**. It provides insights into how well the brand is meeting customer expectations and delivering a positive experience.

There are various methods to calculate satisfaction scores, and one common approach is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). NPS is based on a single question: "**How likely is it that you would recommend our product/service/brand to a friend or colleague?**"

**Calculation of Net Promoter Score (NPS):**

1. **Promoters (Score 9-10):** Customers who are highly satisfied and likely to recommend.
2. **Passives (Score 7-8):** Customers who are satisfied but not enthusiastic.
3. **Detractors (Score 0-6):** Customers who are dissatisfied and may potentially harm the brand's reputation.

NPS= Percentage of Promoters − Percentage of Detractors

The result is a score that can range from -100 to +100. A higher NPS suggests a higher level of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Monitoring satisfaction scores in digital marketing is crucial for understanding customer sentiment, identifying areas for improvement, and maintaining a positive brand image. It can be collected through surveys, feedback forms, or social media monitoring tools to gauge customer opinions and perceptions.
