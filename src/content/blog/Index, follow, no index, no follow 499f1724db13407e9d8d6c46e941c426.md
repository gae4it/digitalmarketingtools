The "index, follow" directive in the meta robots tag tells search engine crawlers to include the page in their index and follow all the links on the page. This means the page will be shown in the search results and the crawlers will follow all the links on the page. The "noindex, follow" directive tells the crawlers not to include the page in their index, but to follow all the links on the page. The "follow" directive alone means the page will be crawled and all the links on the page will be followed, while "noindex" alone means the page will not be included in the search results. These directives are used to control how search engine robots crawl, index, and display a page's content.

The "index, follow" directive is the default behavior for search engine crawlers, so it is often explicitly added to the meta robots tag to ensure that the page is included in the search results and all the links are followed. This is done because search engines have changed how they handle robots directives, and including these directives explicitly has become more important.
