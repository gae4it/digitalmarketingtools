In Germany, copyright law is governed by the Federal Copyright Act and international treaties to which Germany is a party, such as the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.

Here are the main points regarding the functioning of copyright law in Germany:

1. **Protection of the Work:** The work must be original, i.e., the result of the individual creation of the author. No registration or formalities are required to obtain copyright protection. The work is automatically protected from the moment of its creation, which can include literary, artistic, musical, cinematic, photographic, and software works, among others.
2. **Duration of Protection:** Generally, copyright protection lasts for the author's lifetime and an additional 70 years after their death. However, there are exceptions for anonymous or pseudonymous works, collective works, and works created by multiple authors.
3. **Rights of the Author:** The author has various rights over their works, including the right of reproduction, distribution, public performance, communication to the public, and adaptation of the work. These rights allow the author to control the use and dissemination of their work.
4. **Exploitation of Rights:** The author can assign or license their rights to third parties. This can be done through licensing agreements or rights transfer agreements. Authors can also affiliate with collective management societies to manage and collect copyright royalties on their behalf.
5. **Limitations and Exceptions:** German copyright law provides some limitations and exceptions to copyright for purposes such as quotation, parody, personal use, and use for educational or scientific purposes. However, these limitations are subject to certain conditions and requirements.
6. **Copyright Infringement:** Unauthorized use of a copyrighted work constitutes a copyright infringement. The author can pursue legal action to enforce their rights and obtain remedies such as damages or injunctions.

It's important to note that this is only a general overview of copyright law in Germany, and there may be other specific or detailed provisions in the law. In case of specific or complex issues, it is advisable to consult a lawyer specializing in copyright law in Germany.
