# Conversion Rate

In digital marketing, the "conversion rate" is a key performance metric that measures the percentage of website visitors or users who take a desired action, often referred to as a "conversion." A conversion can be any predefined action that aligns with the marketing goals, such as making a purchase, filling out a form, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a resource.

**Formula for Conversion Rate:**

Conversion Rate= (Number of Conversions / Number of Website Visitors or Users) × 100

**Key Points:**

1. **Number of Conversions:** The total number of completed desired actions (e.g., purchases, form submissions, etc.).
2. **Number of Website Visitors or Users:** The total number of people who visited the website or landing page.

For example, if a website receives 1,000 visitors and 50 of them make a purchase, the conversion rate would be 5%.

A higher conversion rate indicates that a higher percentage of visitors are taking the desired actions, reflecting the effectiveness of the digital marketing efforts. Monitoring and optimizing the conversion rate is crucial for improving the overall performance and efficiency of digital marketing campaigns and websites.
