# Backlink Strategy

Link juice is a term used in SEO to describe the value or authority that a backlink passes to the website it connects with. It is the power or equity that a website has based on the number and quality of inbound links pointing to it. The more link juice a page has, the better its chance of ranking for its target keywords in Google and other search engines. Link juice is passed through hyperlinks, and search engines see links as votes by one page for another. Link juice is important for a website's SEO because it helps to improve its search engine rankings. The following are some of the factors that determine link juice:

- **Relevance:** For a link to pass juice, it must be relevant to the target page. This means that the link should be from a page that is about the same topic as the target page. If the link is not relevant, then it will not help the target page have higher search engine rankings.
- **Crawlability:** Search engines must be able to crawl the page that contains the link to pass link juice. If the page is not crawlable, then the link will not pass any link juice.
- **Domain authority:** Websites with more authority are viewed as trustworthy in Google's eyes, and their links pass more juice. Backlinks from websites with higher authority and relevance on a topic will generate more link juice and help a page rank better on the search engine results page (SERP).
- **Internal linking:** Internal linking is another way to pass link juice within a website. Internal link juice is the linking power that is passed on by internal linking to other internal subpages. Here it is important to note the number of internal links on a site. The more links there are, the less link juice is passed on per link. With the targeted distribution of link juice, the pages that are most important to the website operator can be reinforced (e.g., category pages).

In summary, link juice is the value or authority that one link passes to the page that it connects with. It is an important factor in a website's SEO because it helps to improve its search engine rankings. Link juice is not the same as backlink strategy, but it is an important part of it. Backlink strategy is the method through which sites get links from each other.

**Nofollow**

Nofollow is an HTML attribute that can be added to a hyperlink to tell search engines not to follow the link or pass any link equity (also known as "link juice") to the linked page. The nofollow attribute was introduced by Google in 2005 to combat spammy links that were being used to manipulate search engine rankings. When a search engine bot sees a nofollow tag, it simply ignores the link for search ranking purposes. Nofollow links are typically used for unnatural links or when the website owner doesn't want to be associated with the link's target URL. The nofollow attribute should be used for outbound links that are not relevant to the content or when the website owner doesn't want to endorse the linked content. Nofollow links are also used for paid links, blog comments, social media links, and links in forum posts or other forms of user-generated content. The nofollow attribute can be added to a hyperlink by adding rel="nofollow" to the HTML code. The nofollow attribute is not a directive anymore, but instead, it is treated as a hint by Google. Other related attributes include noreferrer, which is used to hide HTTP referral information, and me, which is used to reference a profile on any page.

When a webpage links to another webpage, it passes some of its authority or "link juice" to the linked page. This link juice can help the linked page to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). However, when a nofollow attribute is added to a hyperlink, it tells search engines not to follow the link or pass any link equity to the linked page. This means that the linked page will not receive any benefit from the link in terms of search engine rankings. Nofollow links are typically used for unnatural links or when the website owner doesn't want to be associated with the link's target URL. Nofollow links can still pass other forms of link equity that can benefit the site's overall SEO, such as referral traffic, brand exposure, and social signals. It is important to note that nofollow links are not completely useless, and they can still provide value to a website. However, they should be used strategically and in moderation, and the majority of a website's links should be follow links to maximize its SEO potential.
