# Microtargeting

Microtargeting in marketing refers to the practice of **tailoring advertising or promotional messages to a highly specific and narrowly defined audience**. Instead of reaching out to a broad demographic, microtargeting involves identifying and appealing to individuals or small, well-defined **segments based on** various criteria such as **demographics, interests, behaviors, or purchasing history.**

This approach relies heavily on **data analytics** and technology to gather insights into the preferences and behaviors of individuals. Marketers use this information to create personalized and relevant content, increasing the likelihood of engagement and conversion. Microtargeting is prevalent in digital marketing, where platforms often provide robust tools for advertisers to precisely target their messages to specific user segments.
