# OSS - ONE STOP SHOP IN E-COMMERCE

The One Stop Shop (OSS) procedure in WooCommerce simplifies compliance with the new EU regulations for B2C exports to other EU countries. It involves monitoring the yearly delivery threshold and generating tax reports applicable to the OSS procedure. The "One Stop Shop for WooCommerce" plugin helps monitor the delivery threshold, generate detailed tax reports, adjust tax rates to current EU VAT rates, and apply different tax classes for different EU countries. It also provides compatibility with the Woo HPOS report and excludes local pickup orders. An additional registration for the OSS procedure is required, and timely action is recommended. The OSS procedure affects tax calculation and price labeling, requiring adjustments at the product level. German Market and Germanized Pro are also mentioned as related tools for implementing the OSS procedure in WooCommerce.
